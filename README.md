# HexSoftwares_Movie_Ratings_Project
Analyzing and visualizing IMDb movie ratings using Python and Power BI to identify rating distribution, top movies, and top genres.
# Analyzing and Visualizing IMDb Movie Ratings

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing IMDb movie ratings to understand the overall rating distribution, identify top-rated movies, and determine the best-performing movie genres. The analysis combines Python-based data processing with interactive visualizations created in Power BI.

## Dataset
**Source:** IMDb Movie Dataset  

The dataset contains information about movies including:
- Series_Title
- Genre
- IMDb Rating
- Number of Votes
- Directors and Cast
- Release Year and other metadata

## Tools & Technologies Used
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Power BI Desktop

## Data Analysis Process
1. Data cleaning and preprocessing using Python
2. Calculation of summary statistics (average, minimum, and maximum IMDb ratings)
3. Visualization of rating distribution using histograms and box plots
4. Identification of top-rated movies and genres
5. Creation of an interactive Power BI dashboard to present insights

## Key Findings
- The average IMDb rating is **7.95**
- Most movies are rated between **7.5 and 8.5**
- Drama and Crime-related genres have the highest average ratings
- Top-rated movies include *The Shawshank Redemption*, *The Godfather*, and *12 Angry Men*

## Visualizations
- IMDb rating distribution (histogram)
- Summary statistics (average, minimum, maximum ratings)
- Top 10 highest-rated movies
- Average IMDb rating by genre

## Dashboard
A Power BI dashboard was developed to visually summarize the analysis and key insights in a single interactive view.

## Repository Structure
- `notebook/` – Jupyter Notebook for data analysis
- `data/` – Dataset used for analysis
- `dashboard/` – Power BI dashboard file
- `README.md` – Project documentation

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the use of Python and Power BI for exploratory data analysis and dashboard development, providing meaningful insights into IMDb movie ratings.
